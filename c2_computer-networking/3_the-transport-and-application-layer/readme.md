## The Transport and Application Layers

In the third week of this course, we'll explore the transport and application layers. By the end of this module, you'll be able to describe TCP ports and sockets, identify the different components of a TCP header, show the difference between connection-oriented and connectionless protocols, and explain how TCP is used to ensure data integrity.

### Key Concepts

* Describe TCP ports and sockets.
* Examine the different components of a TCP header.
* Compare differences between connection-oriented and connectionless protocols.
* Explain how TCP is used to ensure data integrity.
