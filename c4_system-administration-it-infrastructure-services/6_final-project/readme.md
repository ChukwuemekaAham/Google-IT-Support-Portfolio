## System Administration Consultation

<br>

**Learning Goals**:

1. Use the systems administration concepts you learned in the course to provide technical improvements to current processes.
2. Implement solutions based on an organization’s restrictions, like financial resources, number of users, etc.

**Overview**: You’ll take what you learned in the System Administration and IT Infrastructure Services course and apply that knowledge to real-world situations.

**Assignment**: For this writing project, you’ll be presented with three scenarios for different companies. You’ll be doing the systems administration for each company’s IT infrastructure. For each scenario, present improvements to processes based on the company’s needs and current restrictions. There’s no right or wrong answer to your consultation, but your responses should explain the problem, the improvement, and the rationale behind them. Please write a 200-400 word process review for each company presented to you.
