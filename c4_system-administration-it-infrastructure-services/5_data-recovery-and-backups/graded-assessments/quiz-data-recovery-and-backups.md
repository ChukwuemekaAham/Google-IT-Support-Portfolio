### Question 1

What types of backup schemes are available? Check all that apply.

* **Full backup**
* **Differential backup**
* **Incremental backup**
* Partial backup

### Question 2

What are the measures included in a disaster recovery plan?

* **Preventative**
* **Detection**
* Testing
* Recovery 

> A disaster recovery plan should incorporate preventative, detection, and recovery measures.

### Question 3

What's a commonly overlooked part of a post-mortem report?

* The summary
* The timeline

### Question 5

What are advantages of on-site backups? Check all that apply.

* **Data is more secure because of less outbound traffic.**
* **There is less bandwidth usage.**
* Data is safe in case of disaster.
