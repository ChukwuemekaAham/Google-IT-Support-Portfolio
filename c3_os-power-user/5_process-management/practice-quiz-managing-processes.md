### Question 1

Which of the following tools can help you gather information about the processes running on a Windows operating system?

* The Task Manager
* The tasklist utility from a command prompt
* The Get-Process commandlet from a PowerShell prompt
* **All of the above**

### Question 2

If you restart a process using the Process Explorer utility, what will the new parent of that process be?

* cmd.exe
* **Process Explorer**
* windows.exe
* momanddad.exe

> Since Process Explorer is the process that initiated the restart, it makes sense that the new parent of the process will be Process Explorer.
