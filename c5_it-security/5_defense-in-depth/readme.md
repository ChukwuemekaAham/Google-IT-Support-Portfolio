## Defense in Depth

In the fifth week of this course, we're going to go more in-depth into security defense. We'll cover ways to implement methods for system hardening, application hardening, and determine the policies for OS security. By the end of this module, you'll know why it's important to disable unnecessary components of a system, learn about host-based firewalls, setup anti-malware protection, implement disk encryption, and configure software patch management and application policies.

### Key Concepts

* Implement the appropriate methods for system hardening.
* Implement the appropriate methods for application hardening.
* Determine the appropriate policies to use for operating system security.
