## Other Attacks

### Question 1

How can you protect against client-side injection attacks? Check all that apply.

* **Use data sanitization**
* Use a SQL database
* Utilize strong passwords
* **Use input validation**

> By checking user-provided input and only allowing certain characters to be valid input, you can avoid injection attacks. You can also use data sanitization, which involves checking user-supplied input that's supposed to contain special characters to ensure they don't result in an injection attack.

### Question 2

True or false: A brute-force attack is more efficient than a dictionary attack.

* TRUE
* **FALSE**

> A brute-force attack tries out every possible valid combination of characters to guess the password, while a dictionary attack only tries passwords contained in a dictionary file. This means the dictionary attack is more efficient, since it doesn't generate the passwords and has a smaller number of guesses to attempt.

### Question 3

Which of the following scenarios are social engineering attacks? Check all that apply.

* An attacker performs a DNS Cache poisoning attack.
* **Someone uses a fake ID to gain access to a restricted area.**
* An attacker performs a man-in-the-middle attack.
* **You receive an email with an attachment containing a virus.**

> A malicious spam email is a form of social engineering; the email is designed to trick you into opening a malicious payload contained in the attachment. Using a fake ID to gain entry to somewhere you're not permitted is impersonation, a classic social engineering technique.
