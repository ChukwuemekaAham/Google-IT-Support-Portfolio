## Malicious Software

<br>

### Question 1

In the CIA Triad, "Confidentiality" means ensuring that data is:

* accurate and was not tampered with.
* **not accessible by unwanted parties.**
* accessible anonymously.
* available and that people can access it.

> "Confidentiality," in this context, means preventing unauthorized third parties from gaining access to the data.

<br>

### Question 2

In the CIA Triad, "Integrity" means ensuring that data is:

* available and that people can access it.
* not accessible by unwanted parties.
* truthful and honest.
* **accurate and was not tampered with.**

> That's not the kind of integrity we're referring to here. Data integrity means ensuring that data is not corrupted or tampered with.

<br>

### Question 3

In the CIA Triad, "Availability" means ensuring that data is:

* available to anyone from anywhere.
* accurate and was not tampered with.
* not accessible by unwanted parties.
* **available and people can access it.**

> "Availability," in this context, means ensuring that data and services remain accessible to those who are authorized to access them.

<br>

### Question 4

What's the relationship between a vulnerability and an exploit?

* A vulnerability takes advantage of an exploit to run arbitrary code or gain access.
* **An exploit takes advantage of a vulnerability to run arbitrary code or gain access.**
* They're unrelated.
* An exploit creates a vulnerability in a system.

> A vulnerability is a bug or hole in a system. It allows an attacker to gain access by using an exploit, which takes advantage of the vulnerability.

<br>

### Question 5

Which statement is true for both a worm and a virus?

* **They're self-replicating and self-propagating.**
* They're undetectable by antimalware software.
* They infect other files with malicious code.
* They don't cause any harm to the target system.

> Both worms and viruses are capable of spreading themselves using a variety of transmission means.

<br>

### Question 6

Check all examples of types of malware:

* Key Generators
* **Adware**
* **Worms**
* **Viruses**

> These three are all examples of unwanted software that can cause adverse affects to an infected system, which is exactly what malware is

<br>

### Question 7

What are the characteristics of a rootkit? Check all that apply.

* **Is difficult to detect**
* Is harmless
* Is destructive
* **Provides elevated credentials**

> A rootkit is designed to provide administrator-level access to a third party without the system owner's knowledge. Given this, rootkits are usually designed to avoid detection and can be difficult to detect.
