## Understanding Security Threats
**Latest Submission Grade: 92.30%**

<br>

### Question 1

A network-based attack where one attacking machine overwhelms a target with traffic is a(n) _______ attack.

* Injection
* Malware
* **Denial of Service**
* Brute force password 

> This is a classic denial-of-service attack. Note that this is not a distributed denial-of-service attack, as the attack traffic is coming from a single source and not distributed over many attacking hosts

<br>

### Question 2

When cleaning up a system after a compromise, you should look closely for any ______ that may have been installed by the attacker.

* Poisoned DNS caches
* **Backdoors**
* Rogue APs
* Injection attacks 

<br>

### Question 3

A(n) _____ attack is meant to prevent legitimate traffic from reaching a service.

* **Denial of Service**
* Injection
* Password
* DNS Cache poisoning

<br>

### Question 4

The best defense against password attacks is using strong _______.

* **Passwords**
* Encryption
* Firewall configs
* Antimalware software 

> Strong passwords will make password attacks too time-consuming to be viable for an attacker.

<br>

### Question 5

Which of these is an example of the confidentiality principle that can help keep your data hidden from unwanted eyes?

* **Protecting online accounts with password protection**
* Making sure the data hasn't been tampered with
* Preventing data loss
* Preventing an unwanted download 

> Password protection can help limit access to your data so that only those who need it can see it.

<br>

### Question 6

What could potentially decrease the availability of security and also test the preparedness of data loss?

* Adware
* Keylogger
* Spyware
* **Ransomware**

> Ransomware could prevent access to your data by holding the data hostage until you pay a ransom.

<br>

### Question 7

Which of these is a characteristic of Trojan malware?

* A Trojan is basically backdoor malware.
* A Trojan may get installed without the userâ€™s consent.
* A Trojan is the same thing as a rootkit.
* **A Trojan infection needs to be installed by the user.**

> Just like how the historical Trojan horse was accepted into the city by the citizens of Troy, a malicious Trojan disguised in a trusted program has to be accepted and executed by the user.

<br>

### Question 8

What is it called when a hacker is able to get into a system through a secret entryway in order to maintain remote access to the computer?

* **A backdoor**
* Ransomware
* A Trojan
* Adware 

> A backdoor is a way for a hacker to get into a system through a secret entryway.

<br>

### Question 9

An unhappy Systems Administrator wrote a malware program to bring down the company's services after a certain event occurred. What type of malware does this describe?

* **A logic bomb**
* A rootkit
* Ransomware
* Spyware 

> A logic bomb is malware that is intentionally triggered by a hacker once a certain event or time has occurred.

<br>

### Question 10

Which of these is where a victim connects to a network that the victim thinks is legitimate, but is really an identical network controlled by a hacker to monitor traffic?

* A Denial of Service (DoS)
* **Evil Twin**
* A logic bomb
* DNS Cache Poisoning 

> The premise of an Evil Twin is for the victim to connect to a network that is identical to a legit one, but it is actually controlled by a hacker.

<br>

### Question 11

How can injection attacks be prevented? Check all that apply.

* **Data sanitization**
* Flood guards
* Log analysis systems
* **Input validation**

> Injection attacks can be mitigated with good software development principles such as validating input. 

<br>

### Question 12

If a hacker targets a vulnerable website by running commands that delete the website's data in its database, what type of attack did the hacker perform?

* A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack
* A dictionary attack
* Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
* **SQL injection** 

> A SQL injection targets an entire website if the site uses a SQL database. If vulnerable, hackers can run SQL commands that allow them to delete web data, copy it, and run other malicious commands.

<br>

### Question 13

An attacker, acting as a postal worker, used social engineering tactics to trick an employee into thinking she was legitimately delivering packages. The attacker was then able to gain physical access to a restricted area by following behind the employee into the building. What type of attack did the attacker perform? Check all that apply.

* Tailgating
* Phishing
* Spoofing
* **Social engineering**

> Social engineering is an attack method that relies heavily on interactions with humans. Humans will always be the weakest link in a security system.

Correct
Yep! These three attack types are designed to trick or deceive people into trusting an attacker. Phishing accomplishes this via email, baiting uses physical props like USB drives, and tailgating happens when the attacker follows you into a restricted area.

Question 2

Correct
That's right! Botnets are designed to infect machines and put them under the control of the botnet controller. They're used to perform computational or network tasks to steal computing resources, like CPU time, memory, and network bandwidth, from the victim.

Question

Correct
You nailed it! It is very easy to send an email and have the From field come from any address you want it to whether it exists or not. For example, you open an email stating it is from your friend's email address that asks you to click a funny link. To you, that seems like a legitimate email, but when you open the link, you suddenly get malware installed. In this case, an attacker spoofed the sender's email address!
