### Introduction to Software

* **Software**: How we, as users directly interact with our computer.
* If **hardware** is the physical stuff that you can pick up and hold, **software** is the intangible instructions that tell the hardware what to do.
* **Coding**: Translating one language to another.
* **Scripting**: Coding in a scripting language.
* **Scripts**: Mainly used to perform a single or limited range task.
* **Programming**: Coding in a programming language.
* **Programming languages**: Special languages that software developers use to write instructions for computers to execute.
* **Copyright**: Used when creating original work.
* **Application software**: Any software created to fulfill a specific need, like a text editor, web browser, or graphic editor.
* **System software**: Software used to keep our core system running, like operating system tools and utilities.
* **Firmware**: Software that's permanently store on a computer component.
* Binary code instructions would be translated to this:
  * Grab some input data from this location in memory.
  * Using the input data, do some math.
  * Then put some output data into this location in memory.
* **Assembly language**: Allowed computer scientiests to use human readable instructions, assembled into code, that the machines could understand.
* Program using machine instructions:
  * Take integer from register 1.
  * Take integer from register 2.
  * Add integer from register1, and register 2, and output to register 4.
* **Compiled programming languages**: Uses human readable instructions, then send them through a compiler.
* The **script** is run by an interpreter, which interprets the code into CPU instructions just in time to run them.

### Interacting with Software

* **Software bug**: An error in software that cause unexpected results.
* **Git**: A version control system that helps keep track of changes made to files and directories.
* **.exe**: A file extension found in Windows for an executable file.
