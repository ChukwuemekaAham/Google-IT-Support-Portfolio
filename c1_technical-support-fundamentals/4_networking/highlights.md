### What is Networking?

* **Internet**: The physical connection of computers and wires around the world.
* **Web**: The information on the Internet.
* Computer on a network have an identifier called an **IP address**.
* Devices that can connect to a network have
another unique identifier called a **MAC address**.
MAC addresses are generally permanent and hard-coded onto a device
* When you send or receive data through a network you need to have both an **IP** and **MAC** address.
* **Router**: Connects lots of different devices together and helps route network traffic.
* **Network stack**: A set of hardware or software that provides the infrastructure for a computer.
* There are rules that make sure our packets are routed efficiently:
  * Routed efficiently.
  * Aren't corrupted.
  * Secure.
  * Right machine.
  * Named appropriately.
* **IP**: Responsible for delivering our packets to the right computers.
* **TCP**: Protocol that handles reliable delivery of information from one network to another. 
* **Uniform Resource Locator (URL)**: Web address similar to a home address.

### Limitations of the Internet

* **IPv4**: Address that consists of 32 bits separated into four groups, something like 172.14.24.1
* **IPv6**: Address that consist of a 128 bits, four times the amount that IPv4 uses, something like 379f:3e7d:4860:0370:7334:0000
* **Network Address Translation (NAT)**: Lets organizations use one public IP address and many private IP addresses within the network.

### Impact of the Internet

* **Globalization**: The movement that lets governments, businesses, and organizations communicate and integrate together on an international scale.
