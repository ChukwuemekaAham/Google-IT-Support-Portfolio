* Ethernet cable
* ISPs and IP addresses
* **MAC address and IP address**
* Username and IP addresses 

> The MAC address and IP address are the unique identifiers that identify devices on a network.

* URL address
* IP address
* ISP address
* **MAC address**

> Devices that can connect to a network have a unique identifier called a MAC (media access control) address. MAC addresses are generally permanent and hard coded onto a device.

<br>

### Question 6

Which statements are true about routers? Check all that apply.

* **A router connects devices together and helps direct network traffic.**
* **A router utilizes network protocols to help determine where to send data packets.**
* A router can only send data to another computer that's on the same network.
* A router is a set of components that makes up computer networking.

> A router connects lots of devices together and helps route network traffic. The packets go through the router, and the router utilizes network protocols to help figure out where to send the data.

* IPv5 is an outdated protocol version with insufficient security safeguards.
* Companies waste hundreds of public IP addresses. With IPv6, they can use just one IP address.
* **There are less than 4.3 billion IPv4 addresses, which has already been exceeded with existing websites.**
* Internet Protocol versions prior to version 6 haven't achieved widespread use. 

> Even though it might seem like a lot of possible IPv4 addresses, there are less than 4.3 billion IPv4 addresses, and there are way more than 4.3 billion websites out on the Web today.

<br>

### Question 9

You need to update your router settings, so you log into the administration panel, whose Internet Protocol (IP) address is 192.168.0.1. Which IP version is this?

* **IPv4**
* IPv1
* IPv2
* IPv6 

> IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is an address that consists of 32 bits separated into 4 groups. This means that each group can have values from 0 to 255, making 192.168.0.1 a valid IPv4 address.
