### Introduction to IT Support

* **Information Technology (IT)**: The use of digital technology, like computers and the Internet, to store and process data into useful information.
* There are thousands of **companies** around the world searching for **IT professionals** like **you**!.

### History of Computing

* **Computer**: A device that stores and processes data by performing calculations.
* **Algorithm**: A series of steps that solve specific problems.
* **Cryptography**: The art of writing and solving codes.
* **Open source**: Anyone could modify and share it.

### Digital Logic

* **Binary system**: The communication that a computer uses, also known as a base-2 numeral system.
* We group binary into 8 number or **bits**. Technically, a **bit** is a binary digit.
* A group of 8 bits is referred to as a **byte**.
* Each byten can store one character, and we can have 256 possible values thanks to the base-2 system (2<sup>8</sup>).
* **Character encoding**: Assigns our binary values to characters, so that we as humans can read them.
* The first character in the ASCII to binary table -- a lowercase 'a' -- maps to 01100001 in binary.
* **Logic gates**: Allow our transistors to do more complex tasks, like decide where to send electrical signals depending on logical conditions.

### Computer Architecture Layer

* **Abstraction**: To take a relatively complex system and simplify it for our use.
* **Hardware layer**: Made up of the physical components of a computer.
* **Operating system**: Allows hardware to communicate with the system.
* **Software layer**: How we as humans interact with our computer.
* **User**: Interacts with the computer.
