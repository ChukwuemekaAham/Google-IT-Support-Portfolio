### The Modern Computer

* **Ports**: Connection points that we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of our computer.
* **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: The brain of our computer, it does all the calculations and data processing.
* **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Our computer's short-term memory.
* **Hard drive**: Holds all of our data, which includes all of our music, pictures, applications.
* **Motherboard**: The body of circulatory system of the computer that connects all the pieces together.
* **Programs**: Instructions that tell the computer what to do.
* There are 3 different cache levels in a CPU: L1, L2, and L3.
* **L1** is the smallest and fastest cache.
* **Clock speed**: The maximum number of clock cycles that it can handle in a certain time period.

### Components

* When you select your CPU, you'll need to make sure it's **compatible** with your **motherboard** -- the circuit board that connects all your components together.
* There are lots of types of RAM, and the one that's commonly found in computers is **DRAM**, or **dynamic random-access memory**.
* There are also different types of memory sticks that **DRAM** chips can be put on. The more modern **DIMM** sticks, which usually stands for **Dual Inline Memory Module**, have different sizes of pins on them.
* In today's system, we use another type of RAM, called **double data rate SDRAM** or **DDR SDRAM** for short.
* **Peripherals**: External devices we connect to our computer, like a mouse, keyboard, and monitor.
* **Expansion slots**: Give us the ability to increase the functionality of our computer
* As general rule, be sure to use the proper voltage for your electronics.
* **Wattage**: The amount of volts and amps that a device needs.
* You can power most basic desktops with a 500W power supply.
* **System on a Chip (SoC)**: Packs the CPU, RAM, and sometimes even the storage onto a single chip.
* **Charge cycle**: One full charge and discharge of a battery.
* **Peripherals**: Anything that you connect to your computer externally that adds functionality.
* **Universal Serial Bus (USB)**: The most popular connections for our gadgets.
    * USB 2.0 - Transfer speeds of 480 Mb/s.
    * USB 3.0 - Transfer speeds of 5 Gb/s.
    * USB 3.1 - Transfer speeds of 10 Gb/s.
* MB is **megabyte** or **unit of data storage**, while Mb/s is a **megabit per second**, which is a **unit of data transfer rate**.
* Remember that **1 byte** is **8 bits**, so to transfer a 1MB file in a second, you need an 8 Mb/s connection speed.

### Starting It Up

* **Standoffs**: Used to raise and attach your motherboard to the case.
* **Heat sink**: Used to issipate heat from our CPU.
* **Thermal paste** : Used to better connect our CPU and heat sink.
* **Factory reset**: Removes all data, apps, and costumizations from the device.
* Best practices for working on a PC:
  * Protect against static discharge.
  * Use the right tools.
  * Keep parts organized and labeled. Taking pictures along the way can help a lot, too.
  * Follow vendor documentation.
  * Test the device to make sure it works.
