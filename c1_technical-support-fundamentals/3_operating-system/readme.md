## Operating System

In the third week of this course, we'll learn about operating systems. We'll discuss the common operating systems that are used today and understand how they work with the computer hardware. We'll learn about the "boot process" of an operating system and show you how to install Windows, Linux and Mac OSX operating systems from scratch. By the end of this module, you'll use the Qwiklabs environment to interact directly with the Windows and Linux operating systems.
