## Course Highlights

### What's an Operating System?

* **Remote connection**: Allows us to manage multiple machines from anywhere in the world.
* **Secure shell (SSH)**: A protocol implemented by other programs to securely access one computer from another.
* **Virtual private network (VPN)**: Allows you to connect to a private network, like your work network, over the Internet.
* **PuTTY**: A free, open source software that you can use to make remote connections through several network protocols, including SSH.
* **Operating system**: The whole package that manages our computer's resources and lets us interact with it.
* Our kernel optimizes **memory usage** and makes sure our applications have enough memory to run
* **I/O management**: Anything that can give us input, or that we can use for output of data.
* We write data to our hard drive in the form of data blocks.
* **Block storage**: Improves faster handling of data because the data isn't stored as one long piece and can be accessed quicker.
* **File extension**: The appended part of a filename that tells us what type of file it is in certain operating system.
* **Process**: A program that's executing, like our internet browser or text editor.
* **Program**: An application that we can run, like Chrome.
* **Time slice**: A very short interval of time that gets allocated to a process for CPU execution.
* **Kernel**: Creates processes, efficiently schedules them, and manages how processes are terminated.
* **Virtual memory**: The combination of hard drive space and RAM that acts like memory that our processes can use.
* **I/O devices**: Devices that perform input and output.
* When you're troubleshooting or solving a problem with a **slow machine**, it's usually some sort of **hardware resource deficiency**.
* **Shell**: A program that interprets text commands and send them to the OS to execute.
* **Logs**: Files that record system events on our computer, just like a system's diary.
* **BIOS/UEFI**: A low-level software that initializes our computer's hardware to makesure everything is good to go.
* **Bootloader**: A small program that operating system.

### Installing an Operationg System

* The **operating systems** in use by an organization have a lot to do with the **applications** and **systems** that they need to run.
* Modern operating systems do a pretty good job of supporting common hardware.
* As an IT Support Specialist, you'll **install** operating system **many times**, so using **one** single disk **won't** be time **efficient** or **scalable**.
* **Virtual machine (VM)**: Just a copy of a real machine.
* Unlike other operating systems, Chrome OS has one main purpose: to be secure and simple way to user to interact with the web.
* Chrome OS machines are iterchangeable because most data is stored in the cloud, not locally.
* Chrome OS user doesn't need to worry about problems or hacks inthe system because it's designed to stay up and running.
