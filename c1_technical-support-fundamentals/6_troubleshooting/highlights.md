### Troubleshooting Best Practices

* **Troubleshooting**: The ability to diagnose and resolve a problem.
* IT Support is about working in the service of others. Always try to create a positive experience for the user.
* **Root cause**: The main factor that's causing a range of issues.
* **Error messages** are super helpful indicators that can point you in the right direction.
* As an IT support specialist, you'll sometime encounter the same issue over and over again. Before the next issue comes in, you may find yourself using your muscle memory to fix the issue.
  * **Pitfall #1**: Going into autopilot, Make sure you don't default to autopilot mode, moving through issues out of habit and without careful thought.
  * **Pitfall #22**: Not finding the root cause, it's very easy to get distracted by small problems that pop up. But it's super important to remember there's probably a very big problem causing all these small problems.

### Customer Service

* In IT support, you work with users to fix technology and improve how people use it. TO accomplish this, you need to develop a trust between you and the user.
* Great customer service requires:
  * Exhibiting emphaty.
  * Being conscious of your tone.
  * Acknowledging the person.
  * Developing trust. 
* The action you take by looking at it from their perspective is what **empathy** is all about.
* **Tone** is historically thought of as how you speak out load.
* Acknowledging the user reduces the tension that might build and help you understand how you're working toward a solution.
* Emphaty and acknowledgement are a big part of building trust. Without these, you'll find it difficult to connect with the user.
* Be honest with the user, even if you think they won't be happy about it.
* Just be professional, acknowledge the user, and show them some respect.
* To really build a rapport, try a personal fact they've mentioned and bring it up later.
* Just make sure you clarify the person's issue before you start to troubleshoot.
* If you're supporting a user remotely and need them to run some commands, don't forget to tell them why you need them to execute the commands.
* The last five minute of the interaction will set the tone for how the user feels walking away from the interaction. So, make sure to end on a positive note.
* It's important to see things from other people's point of view.

### Documenting

* **Tickets**: A common way of documenting an issue.
* **Bugs**: Issues with the system that weren't caused by an external source.
* Documenting important for two reason:
  * It keeps the user in the loop.
  * It helps you audit your steps in case you need to go back and see what you did.
* Write down procedures and policies to create a documentation trail.
* System and processes are constantly changing, and so should your documentation.

### Getting Through a Technical Interview

* Your resume is your first introduction to a new company.
* Research the company that you're applying to.
* Pretending that you're in interview, even if it's not real, will help you perform your best.
* **Elevator pitch**: A short summary of who you are and what kind of career you're looking for.
* When you're interviewing for a technical position, you'll likely have one or more interviews where you'll specifically need to demonstrate your technical skills and knowledge. These interviews may take the form of technical troubleshooting scenarios or explanations of technical concepts and subjects. 
* Having a good problem-solving strategy is more important than knowing all the answers.
* When you mention concepts or technologies, you should be ready to explain them and articulate why you may choose one thing over another.
* It's OK, and even expected, to ask the interviewer follow-up questions to ensure that the problem is correctly framed.
