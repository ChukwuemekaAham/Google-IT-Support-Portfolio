## Troubleshooting Best Practices

<br>

### Question 1

Scenario: You're working in an IT Support position and a user comes to you and says they can't access their online bank account. Choose the best response.

* Let's try to test this by logging in on my computer.
* Please restart your computer.
* It might be the Internet. Make sure you're connected to a network first.
* **Can you explain to me in detail what you mean by not being able to access your online bank account? What specific part doesn't work?**

> Remember, when tasked with a problem, don't jump to conclusions. Ask questions first and gather more information. The issue be an incorrect login, a poor network connection, a server issue with the bank, or something else. Always ask questions first!

### Question 2

Scenario: You're working in an IT Support position. You have a computer that won't connect to the network. You've already asked the user all the necessary questions, and now you begin troubleshooting. What's the next best first step you can take?

* Wipe and format the machine from scratch.
* **Isolate the problem to either the computer or the network.**
* Ask more questions.
* Restart the computer. It could be a weird Internet issue.

> Since you've already gathered information about the problem, it's time to start figuring out what the issue is. There are two things that could be wrong: either the computer is having issues or it's the network. You can rule one out by testing whether or not someone else is able to connect to the network.

### Question 3

Scenario: You're working in an IT Support position and a user comes to you and says they can't login to their computer. Choose the best response.

* **Ask the user, "when was the last time you were able to login? What has changed since then?"**
* Check if the user has their caps lock enabled.
* Restart the computer. It could be a weird login issue.
* Check the network device they're connected to.

> Remember to ask questions in order to try to figure out what happened before the issue came up.

### Question 4

Scenario: You're working with a computer that doesn't run your newly installed software correctly. You've already asked the right questions, but you can't seem to isolate the problem to anything specific. Which of the following responses is the next best step to take?

* Run diagnostic tools, which will take about an hour.
* Wipe the computer and format it from scratch, which will take a few hours.
* **Restart the computer. It could be an issue of the software installation needing a reboot, restarting takes about 2 minutes.**
* Reinstall the software again, which will take about 15 minutes.

> A reboot might be required for the software to be fully installed. In this case, a reboot is also the quickest troubleshooting step to take.
