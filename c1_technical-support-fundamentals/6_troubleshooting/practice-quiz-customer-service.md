## Customer Service

<br>

### Question 1

Free response: What's the difference between good and great customer service? What's the most important part of customer service to you?

```
Good customer service provides solution that customers need and make them satisfied.
Great customer service do the same thing -- but also create good relationship and make them loyal.
```

> Great customer service is unique to each individual. A good rule of thumb is treat others like you would like to be treated.

### Question 2

You're doing desktop support and the company policy is that you can only help with company equipment. A user walks in:

> **Tech**: Hi there, how can I help you?
> 
> **User**: My computer is really slow and I can barely use it. Can you help me figure out what's wrong?
> 
> **Tech**: It looks like this is a personal computer. Are you talking about your work computer?
> 
> **User**: Uh, no, this is the one that I need help with. I figured you’re good with computers and you could help. My daughter needs it for a school assignment that’s due tomorrow, but it's too slow for her to get anything done.

**What would you do?**

* Forget about that pesky policy and help him! His poor daughter needs to finish her assignment!
* Politely tell him that it's against the company policy, and you can’t help him.
* **Explain why you can’t troubleshoot the issue, per the company policy. But give him some tips on what common issues could be slowing down his computer, and how he might go about fixing them.**
* Tell him you can’t help him and suggest that he go to a local tech store for help.

> This response sets expectations and then gives some helpful suggestions. Here, you're showing the user that you care about their issue, even if you can’t help them.

### Question 3

**Situation**: You work for a company that requires a visual verification when resetting passwords. The verification doesn't have to be done through your company account. However, you must see the person "live" (not through a picture), so that you can match them to their photo before resetting their account.

> **Scenario**: Phone call
>
> **Anastasia**: Thanks for calling. My name is Anastasia. How can I help you?
> 
> **Ling**: Hi, Anastasia. This is Ling. I need to reset my account password.
> 
> **Anastasia**: Hi, Ling. I’d be happy to help you with that, but first I need to verify your identity. Can you do a video call with me through Skype?
> 
> **Ling**: I can’t get into my work account. That's why I’m calling.
> 
**What would you do in this situation?** Check all that apply.

* **Offer to set up a video call through Skype, Facetime, or Hangouts.**
* **Suggest that the user does a video call with you through their phone.**
* **Ask the user if they have a personal account to use for Skype.**
* Kindly tell them that they will have to wait until the next day to meet with someone live.

> You're all about thinking outside the box to figure out what else the user can do to set up that call. You could potentially suggest that they go to an internet cafe or local library with wifi, too.

### Question 4

A user needs their password reset. The IT Support Specialist is pulling up the necessary information while the user starts asking a bunch of questions: Why does the password have to have a capital and a symbol? Why can’t I write it down? Why does it change so often? Isn’t this a waste of time?

How would you respond to the user?

* Stop what you're doing and explain to the user that passwords should have numbers and symbols for security purposes, and that this is more important than productivity.
* Kindly ask the user to stop asking questions, since you're trying to solve their problem.
* Ignore the user and keep working on resetting the password so that you don’t lose your place.
* **Let the user know that you're working on their issue and will be sure to answer all of their questions once you're done.**

> You're acknowledging the user’s questions, but setting a clear agenda of what you want to accomplish. This allows them to understand what they should anticipate and helps you keep control of the conversation.

### Question 5

A user walks in to get IT support. The IT Support Specialist is a female. The user is male. There's also a male IT Support Specialist in the room. The user explains to the IT Support Specialist that his co-worker is on leave and he needs to access her files. The female technician attempts to explain the policy, which doesn't allow for this, given security issues. The male user demands to speak with the male IT Support Specialist to reach a solution.

If you were the male technician in this situation, what would you do?

* Step in and answer the user's question.
* Ignore it.
* After the user has left, see how the female tech is doing and give her tips on how to deal with similar situations in the future.
* **Tell the user that there is no difference in knowledge and understanding between you and your co-worker.**

> You are not going as far as confronting the user, which can be really difficult. Rather, you're reinforcing and supporting her work as a fellow IT Support Specialist. It's not always the person being undermined who is responsible for "sticking up for herself."
