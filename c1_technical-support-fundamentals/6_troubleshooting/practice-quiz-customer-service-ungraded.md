### Question 1

You are taking on the role of an IT professional in four different scenarios. Use your best judgement to solve problems presented by users in this choose-your-own-path exercise.

<br>

### Scenario 1 of 4

> **Executive Talking Over You**
> 
> A user calls in and states that they’re a director, and they need some software installed immediately. You explain that this hasn’t been checked for malicious software yet and could infect his computer. While you can perform this check for him, it will take a little time. The users cuts you off, raising his voice and demanding you do it!
> 
> <br>
> 
> **What would you do?**
> 
> > Pause and stay silent about 10 seconds, after he’s done talking, and then respond.
> 
> You pause and try again to assure the director that you understand his desire to expedite this request. You start to explain the need for security, but he talks over you again.
> 
> <br>
> 
> **What do you do?**
> 
> > Pause a little longer. When you talk again, you immediately state that the process will take about 20 minutes, and that you can start on it immediately.
> 
> While it’s good to explain the “why” of a situation, if the user is in a big rush, get to the point. Let them know upfront what you can do to resolve the situation and get the process going.

### Scenario 2 of 4

> **Customer Chat**
> 
> **Name**: Ali Ababwa\
> **Customer number**: 1434216\
> **Issue**: I can’t get my photos and files off my computer, HELP!\
> **Machine**: Windows 10
> 
> **Chat log**:
>
> **Tech**: Hi Ali, how are you today? It looks like you’re having issues accessing your photos and data. Can you give me more details?\
> **User**: I’m awful ;( I have a presentation in an hour and all of my photos and files are gone! Please transfer them to a new machine ASAP.\
> **Tech**: I’m so sorry to hear that! I will do everything I can to help you. When did this happen? What are you trying to do to retrieve them?\
> **User**: My computer fell in the pool at my hotel, and now it won’t turn on.
>
> <br>
>
> **What would you do?**
>
> > Show concern, then ask if he has backups to the cloud setup.
>
> <br> 
>
> **Tech**:Oh my, that isn’t good! Have you saved your files to another medium, like a hard drive or a USB drive? Or perhaps you used a program that saves things to the cloud?\
> **User**: Ugh, no. If I had done these things, do you think I’d be so upset! Can you or can you not retrieve my files?\
> **Tech**: I understand that you’re upset. I’m looking at all of your options to see what we can do to fix this. The computer is dead if it went into the pool, so we need to see what our other options are.\
> **User**: This is ridiculous! Why do I pay for tech support if you can’t support me?
>
> <br>
>
> **What would you do?**
>
> > Ask Ali if he emailed the presentation to any of his co-workers, and remind him that you’re here to help.
>
> While it’s easy to give up on someone when they’re getting upset, it’s important to remember that they may be under a tremendous amount of stress. By coming up with alternatives, you can let them know that you’re on their side and that you’re not going to give up. This doesn’t mean that you should take verbal abuse. Make sure you’re clear with your manager about what you will and won’t accept from a user.

### Scenario 3 of 4

> **Customer Chat**
> 
> **Name**: Yuki Saitō\
> **Customer number**: 674213\
> **Issue**: I need more bandwidth
> 
> **Chat log**:
> 
> **Mia**: Hi Yuki, how are you today? I see that you are concerned about needing more bandwidth. I’d be happy to help.\
> **Yuki**: Thanks, I really need it!
> 
> <br>
> 
> **What would you do?**
> 
> > Ask them what they mean by “bandwidth.”
> 
> People sometimes confuse technical terms. Make sure that you’re using the same vocabulary as the user by clarifying what they mean or probing to understand what they’re trying to accomplish.
> 
> <br>
> 
> **Mia**: Can I ask what you mean by “bandwidth?”\
> **Yuki**: I mean that everytime I try to use my computer after lunch, it’s incredibly slow. I think I’m using all the bandwidth in the morning.
> 
> <br>
> 
> **What would you do?**
> 
> > Ask more questions about what programs they’re using.
> 
> > Ask if this happens for the rest of the day, or just a period of the day?
> 
> While both B and D answer options are correct, this response shows that you were paying attention to the little clues that people leave. The user mentions that this always happens after lunch. Pinpointing the exact time of day and programs used will help you better diagnose the issue faster.

### Scenario 4 of 4

> **Customer Ticket**
> 
> **From the user**:
> 
> My machine is saying I have to reboot, but this is silly. I have a ton of processes running, I don’t want to have to reload everything. This is a waste of time. I’ve included a screenshot of the message. Please advise.
> 
> **-Aditya**
> 
> <br>
> 
> **From the tech**:

> 
> Acknowledge the information that the user has provided. This also allows you to clarify the problem and ensure that you’re on the same page with the user.
>
> <br>
>
> **What could Amelia have done better in the probing of this email?**
> 
> > Based on the screenshot you provided, it looks like you received the reboot prompt because a new program was installed. In order for the program to start working, you’ll need to reboot your machine. Is it possible to save your commands beforehand, so that you can get to them again?
> 
> You’re letting the user know that you’ve looked at the information they provided, explained why the reboot is needed, and suggested a possible workaround to their concern.
>
> <br>
>
